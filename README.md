# Calculator
![](https://learnjavascript.today/images/comps/calculator.gif)
It's a calculator that functions exactly like an iPhone calculator (but without the +/- and percentage keys).
## General Info
This project perform the basic function (multiply, divide,substract and add), but also perform all the edge cases that a calculator can have because each edge case is testing with console.assert.

The calculator have keyboard interaction. Also you can move through the calculator with the arrow keys.

This calculator is a Manal Library, so anyone can download and using in your project.

## Technologies
A list of technologies used within the project:
- HTML

## Collaboration
Give instructions on how to collaborate with your project.
There are a set of rules to keep in mind:

- Perform work in a feature branch.
  _Why:_
  > Because this way all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the main branch. It allows you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code. [read more...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)
- Branch out from `main`

  _Why:_

  > This way, you can make sure that code in master will almost always build without problems, and can be mostly used directly for releases (this might be overkill for some projects).

- Never push into `main` branch. Make a Pull Request.

  _Why:_

  > It notifies team members that they have completed a feature. It also enables easy peer-review of the code and dedicates forum for discussing the proposed feature.

- Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.
  _Why:_
  > It will clutter up your list of branches with dead branches. It ensures you only ever merge the branch back into (`main`) once. Feature branches should only exist while the work is still in progress.

- Comment your code. Try to make it as clear as possible.
- Don't use comments as an excuse for a bad code. Keep your code clean.
- Don't use clean code as an excuse to not comment at all.
- Keep comments relevant as your code evolves.
